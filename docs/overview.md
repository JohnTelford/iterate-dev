Iterate-Dev Overview

---

Iterative development is a project development methodology that breaks down development tasks into smaller, more manageable components.

This approach utilizes a distributed version control system, specifically designed to handle projects of any size with speed and efficiency.

Team members simultaneously work on components, fostering a collaborative environment that facilitates learning from past experiences and continuous improvements. Moreover, it simplifies collaboration and enables changes without disrupting the entire project. Developers share their changes on private Internet addresses for stakeholders to review and provide feedback.

Key functionalities of the distributed version control system include managing changes to a project repository. Team members cannot directly modify the project repository; instead, they clone a copy to their workstation. They make their changes, request the repository guardian to add them to the project repository. The guardian waits for approval from other team members before making changes. Once approved, the guardian makes the changes, and team members refresh their copies of the project repository. This process continues throughout the project’s duration.

The project repository serves as the central repository of project truth, meticulously documenting who made changes, when, where, and why for the entire project’s duration.
